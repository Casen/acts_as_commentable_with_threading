Acts As Commentable (now with comment threads (TM)!!!  -- kidding on the (TM))
===================

Allows for threaded comments to be added to multiple and different models.  Drop-in compatible for acts_as_commentable (however requiring a database schema change)

***NOTE: This plugin requires that you also install the awesome_nested_set plugin. 

		script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set.git

== Resources

Install

  Rails

   * To install as a plugin:
 
    script/plugin install git://github.com/elight/acts_as_commentable_with_threading.git 
 
 * Create a new rails migration and add the following self.up and self.down methods

 * These are the required fields for the database migration, however you may add any additional fields you need.
 
  def self.up
    create_table "comments", :force => true do |t|
      t.integer "commentable_id", :default => 0
      t.string "commentable_type", :limit => 15, :default => ""
      t.text "body", :default => ""
      t.integer "user_id", :default => 0, :null => false
      t.integer "parent_id"
      t.integer "lft"
      t.integer "rgt"
      t.timestamps
    end
  
    add_index "comments", "user_id"
    add_index "comments", "commentable_id"
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :comments
  end

== Usage
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_commentable
 end
 
 * Add a comment to a model instance, for example an Article

	@article = Article.find(params[:id])
	@user_who_commented = @current_user
	@comment = Comment.build_from(@article, @user_who_commented.id, "Hey guys this is my comment!" )
	
 * To make a newly created comment into a child/reply of another comment

	comment.move_to_child_of(the_desired_parent_comment)
	
 * To retrieve all comments for an article, including child comments
	
	@all_comments = @article.comment_threads
	
 * To retrieve only the root comments without their children comments
	
	@root_comments = @article.root_comments
	
 * To check if a comment has children

	@comment.has_children?
	
 * To verify the number of children a comment has
	
	@comment.children.size
	
 * To retrieve a comments children

	@comment.children
	
	
 *If you plan to use the acts_as_voteable plugin with your comment system be sure to uncomment two things:

	in lib/comment.rb uncomment the line "acts_as_voteable"
	in lib/acts_as_commentable_with_threading.rb uncomment the line "include Juixe::Acts::Voteable" near the top
